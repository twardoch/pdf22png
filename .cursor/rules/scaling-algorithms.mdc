## Scale Specification Model
```swift
enum ScaleType {
    case percentage(Double)   // "150%"
    case factor(Double)      // "2.0" 
    case fixedWidth(Int)     // "800x"
    case fixedHeight(Int)    // "x600"
    case boundingBox(Int, Int) // "800x600"
}
```

Core scaling algorithms supporting:

1. Percentage-Based Scaling
- Direct percentage multiplier (e.g. "150%")
- Fractional percentages supported
- Auto-adjusts for image quality preservation

2. DPI-Based Resolution Scaling 
- Input DPI detection and mapping
- Target DPI specification
- DPI ratio calculation for scale factor
- Default 144 DPI baseline

3. Dimension-Based Constraints
- Fixed width with auto-height
- Fixed height with auto-width
- Bounding box fitting with aspect preservation
- Maximum dimension limits

4. Aspect Ratio Logic
- Original aspect ratio preservation
- Intelligent fitting within constraints
- Auto-padding for dimension alignment

The scaling system implements specialized PDF-to-PNG conversion with focus on quality preservation and flexible output formats. Scale specifications support multiple input formats while maintaining consistent rendering quality through intelligent DPI and dimension management.
