## Core Rendering Components

### PDF Page Extraction (Importance: 95)
- Extracts individual PDF pages using Core Graphics
- Handles both single page and batch extraction modes
- Validates page numbers against document bounds
- Manages PDF document context and page references

### CoreGraphics Rendering (Importance: 90)
- Creates bitmap contexts sized to target dimensions
- Applies transformation matrix for scaling/positioning
- Renders PDF content through CoreGraphics drawing
- Handles different color spaces and bit depths
- Preserves vector quality during rasterization

### Transparency Handling (Importance: 85)
- Supports transparent backgrounds through alpha channel
- Creates RGBA bitmap contexts when transparency enabled
- Maintains PDF transparency groups during rendering
- Properly blends transparent elements

### PNG Compression Pipeline (Importance: 80)
- Configurable compression levels (0-9)
- Converts rendered bitmap to PNG format
- Handles color space conversion for output
- Manages PNG metadata and color profiles
- Supports both file and stream-based output

### Scale Management (Importance: 75)
- Calculates render dimensions from scale specifications
- Supports percentage, DPI, and fixed dimension scaling
- Maintains aspect ratios during scaling
- Applies appropriate transform matrices
