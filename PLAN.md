# PDF22PNG MVP 1.0 Production Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the roadmap to transform pdf22png from a feature-complete prototype into a robust, production-ready MVP 1.0. The primary goal is to deliver a stable, performant, and user-friendly PDF to PNG conversion tool that meets professional software standards.

## Current State Assessment

### Strengths
- **Feature Complete**: All core functionality implemented
- **Dual Implementation**: Both Swift and Objective-C versions working
- **Cross-Platform**: Universal binary support (Intel + Apple Silicon)
- **Well-Tested**: Basic test coverage for core functions
- **Good Documentation**: Comprehensive README and examples

### Critical Issues
- **Technical Debt**: Maintaining two implementations creates complexity
- **Production Gaps**: Missing code signing, man pages, integration tests
- **Performance Unknowns**: No stress testing or benchmarks
- **User Experience**: Error handling could be more user-friendly
- **Distribution**: Not ready for App Store or enterprise deployment

## Strategic Decisions

### 1. Implementation Consolidation
**Decision**: Standardize on **Swift implementation** as the primary and only supported version.

**Rationale**:
- Modern language with better safety guarantees
- Easier maintenance and evolution
- Better tooling and debugging support
- Swift Concurrency provides superior async handling
- ArgumentParser provides better CLI experience

**Migration Plan**:
- Port any missing Objective-C features to Swift
- Maintain Objective-C version only for compatibility during transition
- Deprecate Objective-C version in MVP 1.1

### 2. Quality and Reliability Focus
**Decision**: Prioritize stability and error handling over new features.

**Rationale**:
- MVP 1.0 should be rock-solid with existing features
- User trust is built on reliability, not feature count
- Professional tools need comprehensive error handling
- Performance predictability is crucial for batch operations
