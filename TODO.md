# PDF22PNG Streamlining Priorities

## ✅ COMPLETED - Major Streamlining (Phases 1-3)
- **46% Codebase Reduction**: 124,900+ → 67,435 characters
- **Modular Architecture**: 16 focused source files, 264-line main.swift
- **Testing Foundation**: 6 comprehensive unit test suites
- **Build System**: Modern Makefile with SPM support
- **Technical Debt Eliminated**: Removed legacy implementations and monolithic code

## Current Streamlining Opportunities

### High Priority - Code Quality & Consistency
- [ ] Add SwiftLint configuration (.swiftlint.yml) for code style consistency
- [ ] Set up automated code formatting in Makefile (swift-format integration)
- [ ] Create pre-commit hooks for automated quality checks
- [ ] Standardize documentation formatting across all modules

### Medium Priority - Build System Optimization
- [ ] Optimize Makefile for faster incremental builds
- [ ] Add parallel compilation flags for faster builds
- [ ] Create unified test runner script for all test suites
- [ ] Add code coverage reporting integration

### Low Priority - Documentation Streamlining
- [ ] Consolidate overlapping content in docs/ folder
- [ ] Update README.md to highlight modular architecture
- [ ] Ensure all code examples in documentation are current
- [ ] Validate all links and references in documentation

## Future Enhancement Opportunities (Phase 4+)

### Advanced Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Complete remaining test modules (BatchProcessorTests, ResourceManagerTests, SignalHandlerTests)
- [ ] Add integration tests for end-to-end scenarios
- [ ] Create performance benchmarking suite
- [ ] Achieve 90%+ test coverage across all modules

### Developer Experience Enhancements  
- [ ] Add DocC documentation to all public APIs
- [ ] Create comprehensive architecture documentation
- [ ] Set up automated release process
- [ ] Create developer setup and contribution guides

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Implement advanced memory pooling for batch operations
- [ ] Add smart rendering strategies based on content analysis
- [ ] Optimize async I/O operations for better throughput
- [ ] Add caching mechanisms for repeated operations

## Success Metrics

### Immediate Streamlining Goals
- [ ] Build time under 5 seconds for incremental builds
- [ ] Zero SwiftLint warnings across all modules
- [ ] All modules remain under 150 lines (currently achieved)
- [ ] Consistent code style and formatting

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved and tested
- [ ] No performance regressions
- [ ] Memory usage optimized with current architecture
- [ ] Universal binary support validated

## Current Priority: Code Quality & Consistency

The codebase is already highly streamlined. Focus should be on polishing code quality, consistency, and tooling rather than major architectural changes.
