- [ ] Implement adaptive batch sizing improvements
- [ ] Add memory leak detection and prevention

## Phase 7: Quality & Automation Tools

### Week 5: Code Quality Tools
- [ ] Create .swiftlint.yml configuration
- [ ] Set up swift-format integration
- [ ] Create pre-commit hooks for formatting and linting
- [ ] Add automated code quality checks to CI

### Week 5: Development Automation
- [ ] Create scripts/release.sh for automated releases
- [ ] Set up automated dependency updates
- [ ] Create development environment setup script
- [ ] Add code coverage reporting

## Phase 8: Final Polish & Release

### Week 6: Performance Validation
- [ ] Benchmark current vs new architecture performance
- [ ] Validate memory usage improvements
- [ ] Test processing speed maintenance
- [ ] Verify startup time improvements
- [ ] Run regression tests against baseline

### Week 6: Release Preparation

- [ ] Test universal binary builds (Intel + Apple Silicon)
- [ ] Validate all platforms and deployment targets

## Success Criteria Validation

### Code Quality Metrics
- [ ] All modules under 200 lines (currently achieved)
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage across all modules
- [ ] 100% public API documentation coverage
- [ ] Zero SwiftLint warnings or errors

### Performance Metrics
