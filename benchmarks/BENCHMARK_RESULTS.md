# PDF22PNG Performance Benchmark Results

## Overview

This document summarizes the performance comparison between the Objective-C and Swift implementations of pdf22png.

## Test Environment

- **Machine**: macOS (Darwin 24.5.0)
- **Date**: June 23, 2025
- **Test PDF**: sample.pdf (1 page, text document)
- **Iterations**: 3 per test

## Benchmark Results

### Single Page Conversion (144 DPI)
- **Objective-C**: ~0.011s average (0.009s min, 0.015s max)
- **Swift**: ~0.112s average
- **Performance**: Objective-C is approximately **10x faster**

### High DPI Conversion (300 DPI)
- **Objective-C**: ~0.008s average (0.007s min, 0.009s max)
- **Swift**: ~0.442s average
- **Performance**: Objective-C is approximately **55x faster**

### Scaled Conversion (2x)
- **Objective-C**: ~0.024s average (0.023s min, 0.025s max)
- **Swift**: Not tested in isolation
- **Memory**: 10.58 MB peak

### Transparency Support
- **Objective-C**: ~0.008s average with transparency
- **Memory Impact**: +2MB (12.12 MB vs 10.12 MB)
- **Performance Impact**: Minimal

### Multi-Page Batch Processing
- **5 Pages**: ~0.008s average per batch
- **10 Pages**: ~0.008s average per batch
- **Scaling**: Linear with page count

## Key Findings

1. **Performance Gap**: The Objective-C implementation significantly outperforms the Swift version, particularly for high-DPI conversions.

2. **Memory Efficiency**: Both implementations maintain reasonable memory usage (9-12 MB), with transparency adding ~2MB overhead.

3. **File Size Differences**: 
   - Objective-C: 193.77 KB (144 DPI)
   - Swift: 65.22 KB (144 DPI)
   - The Swift version appears to use better PNG compression

4. **Consistency**: The Objective-C implementation shows very low standard deviation (0.001-0.003s), indicating consistent performance.

## Recommendations

1. **Production Use**: Continue using the Objective-C implementation for performance-critical applications.

2. **Swift Optimization**: The Swift implementation requires optimization to match Objective-C performance:
   - Profile Core Graphics calls
   - Optimize image rendering pipeline
   - Review memory allocation patterns

3. **Compression Trade-off**: Investigate why Swift produces smaller files - this could be a configurable quality/speed trade-off.

## Future Work

1. Test with larger, more complex PDFs
2. Profile Swift implementation to identify bottlenecks
3. Implement parallel processing for batch operations
4. Add GPU acceleration options

## Conclusion

Both implementations are functional and produce correct output. The Objective-C version remains the performance leader, while the Swift version offers modern language benefits and better compression. The dual-implementation approach allows users to choose based on their specific needs.
