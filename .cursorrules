## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


uicu is a Python package providing a Pythonic interface to Unicode functionality through PyICU integration and fontTools.unicodedata supplementation.

## Core Domain Components

### Unicode Integration Layer
- Wraps PyICU's low-level Unicode operations into Pythonic interfaces
- Supplements with additional Unicode data from fontTools.unicodedata
- Integrates with Python's native Unicode handling

### Key Business Areas
1. Unicode Data Access
- Character properties and metadata retrieval
- Writing system information integration
- Script and language detection services

2. Text Processing Pipeline
- Character decomposition and normalization
- Script identification and analysis
- Unicode data enrichment flows

### Implementation Priorities
1. Natural Pythonic interfaces to Unicode functionality
2. Integration with Python's native Unicode support 
3. Rich Unicode metadata access and manipulation
4. Performance-optimized Unicode operations

### Critical Files
- src/uicu/uicu.py: Core Unicode processing logic
- src/uicu/__init__.py: Package interface definitions

The system focuses on providing high-level Unicode capabilities while abstracting the complexities of the underlying C/C++ libraries through an idiomatic Python interface.
