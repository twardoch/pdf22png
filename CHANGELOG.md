All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- File overwrite protection with interactive prompts
  - New `-f/--force` flag to bypass overwrite prompts
  - Interactive confirmation when files would be overwritten
  - Dry-run mode now shows which files would be overwritten
  - Non-interactive mode defaults to not overwriting existing files
- Enhanced error reporting with troubleshooting hints
  - Context-aware error messages provide specific guidance
  - Automatic troubleshooting suggestions based on error type
  - Covers PDF-related, file I/O, memory, scaling, and page range errors
  - Improved user experience with actionable error resolution

### Fixed
- Fixed sign comparison warnings in utils.m (NSInteger vs NSUInteger)
- Replaced XCTest dependency with custom test runner for better compatibility
- Improved test coverage with overwrite protection functionality tests

## [1.1.0] - 2025-06-22

### Added
- Automated release script (`release.sh`) with semantic versioning support
  - Automatic version detection from git tags
  - Minor version auto-increment capability
  - Build verification before tagging
  - Colored output for better readability
- Complete GitHub Actions workflow for automated releases with:
  - Universal binary builds for Intel and Apple Silicon
  - PKG installer generation with proper macOS installer structure
  - DMG disk image creation with install script
  - Automated SHA-256 checksum generation
  - GitHub release creation with all artifacts
- New `-n/--name` flag for including extracted text in output filenames
  - Extracts text directly from PDF pages using Core Graphics
  - Falls back to OCR using Vision framework when no text is found
  - Generates slugified filenames like `prefix-001--extracted-text.png`
  - Maximum 30 characters for text suffix, properly truncated at word boundaries
  - Only available in batch mode for performance reasons
- Page range selection with `-p/--page` option supporting complex ranges
  - Single pages: `-p 5`
  - Ranges: `-p 5-10`
  - Comma-separated lists: `-p 1,3,5-10,15`
  - Works in both single page and batch modes
  - Validates ranges against total page count
- Dry-run mode with `-D/--dry-run` flag
  - Preview all operations without writing any files
  - Shows what files would be created with their dimensions
  - Estimates file sizes based on image dimensions
  - Works with all output modes (file, stdout, batch)
  - Useful for testing command options before actual conversion
- Custom naming patterns with `-P/--pattern` option for batch mode
  - `{basename}` or `{name}` - Input filename without extension
  - `{page}` - Page number with automatic padding
  - `{page:03d}` - Page number with custom padding (e.g., 001, 002)
  - `{text}` - Extracted text from page (requires -n flag)
  - `{date}` - Current date in YYYYMMDD format
  - `{time}` - Current time in HHMMSS format
  - `{total}` - Total page count
  - Example: `'{basename}_p{page:04d}_of_{total}'` â†’ `document_p0001_of_10.png`

### Fixed
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to use modern actions (replaced deprecated create-release@v1 with softprops/action-gh-release@v1)
- Fixed binary path references throughout release workflow
- Corrected build paths in distribution packaging
- Added @autoreleasepool blocks in renderPDFPageToImage() and batch processing loops to prevent memory buildup
- Fixed memory leaks in error paths by ensuring proper cleanup of Core Graphics resources
- Fixed unused variables warnings (scaleXSet, scaleYSet) in calculateScaleFactor()
- Added PDF validation to check for encrypted PDFs and empty documents before processing
- Created unified error handling system with dedicated errors.h header and standardized error codes
- Implemented partial batch recovery - failed pages are now skipped instead of stopping entire batch
- Added graceful shutdown with signal handlers (SIGINT, SIGTERM) for batch operations
- Added progress reporting for batch operations (shows every 10 pages processed)

### Changed
- Reorganized project structure for better maintainability:
  - Build output now goes to `build/` directory instead of project root
  - Updated Makefile to use dedicated build directory with proper dependencies
  - Modified universal build script to output to `build/` directory
  - Updated all scripts and workflows to reference new build location
- Improved build system with explicit directory creation
- Enhanced clean target to properly remove all build artifacts

### Removed
- Removed old monolithic `pdf22png.m` from root directory (superseded by modular version in `src/`)

### Documentation
- Created comprehensive improvement plan in TODO.md with:
  - Critical stability and memory management fixes
  - High-priority user experience enhancements
  - Performance optimization opportunities
  - Testing infrastructure requirements
  - Code modernization roadmap
  - Security hardening recommendations
  - Phased implementation strategy
