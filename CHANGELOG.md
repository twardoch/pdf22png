## [2.1.0 / 2.2.0] - 2025-06-27

### Major Change: Implementation Renaming
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: The project now provides two distinct implementations with different names:
  - **pdf21png** (v2.1.0): The Objective-C implementation, formerly `pdf22png`
  - **pdf22png** (v2.2.0): The Swift implementation, formerly `pdf22png-swift`
- This change clarifies the purpose and evolution of each tool:
  - pdf21png = Mature, stable, performance-focused (version 2.1)
  - pdf22png = Modern, evolving, feature-rich (version 2.2)

### Migration Guide
- If you have scripts using `pdf22png`, they will now use the Swift implementation
- For performance-critical applications, switch to `pdf21png`
- Both tools maintain backward compatibility with existing command-line options

### Fixed
- Fixed "use of undeclared identifier 'programName'" error in `pdf21png.m` by replacing `programName` with `argv[0]`.
- Fixed "conflicting types for 'shouldOverwriteFile'" and "too few arguments to function call" errors by removing the `interactive` parameter from `shouldOverwriteFile` in `utils.m` and `utils.h`.
- Confirmed that both Objective-C and Swift implementations build and pass tests.
- Updated `bench.sh` script to use correct binary paths after renaming
- Cleaned up old binary artifacts from build directories
- Marked implementation renaming tasks as complete in TODO.md

### Updated (2025-06-27)
- Updated Swift implementation's `main.swift` to use "pdf22png" as commandName instead of "pdf22png-swift"
- Updated version number in Swift implementation to 2.2.0 for consistency
- Added comprehensive migration guide to root README.md explaining the differences between implementations
- Added comparison table to help users choose between pdf21png and pdf22png
- Verified all tests pass after renaming (both implementations generate 134 PNG files successfully)
- Verified Homebrew formulas exist for both pdf21png and pdf22png
- Confirmed GitHub Actions workflows are updated with correct paths
- Marked completed tasks in TODO.md

### Remaining Tasks
The following tasks remain for future completion:
- Update documentation files in docs/ directory for dual implementation structure
- Update installation scripts (install.sh, uninstall.sh, dev-setup.sh)
- Update benchmark files to use new binary names
- Create man pages for both pdf21png and pdf22png

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Documentation**: dual man pages (`docs/pdf22png.1`, `docs/pdf21png.1`) clarifying Swift vs Objective-C binaries.
- **Docs**: Usage, API, Examples all now reference both binaries.
- **Plan**: Introduced Phase 14 streamlining roadmap in `PLAN.md` with detailed tasks.
- **Tests**: New `ScaleSpecTests` unit-test target covering core scale parsing logic.

### Changed
- **Scripts**: `dev-setup.sh` root-dir check & build logic updated for dual-implementation layout.
- **Package.swift**: added explicit `ScaleUtilitiesTests` test target.
- **TODO.md**: cleaned completed items, added Phase 14 checklist.

### Removed
- Placeholder and obsolete Swift test suites (`ArgumentParserTests`, `InputValidatorTests`, `CoreTests`, legacy test runner) preventing clean build.

  - Works with all output modes (file, stdout, batch)
  - Useful for testing command options before actual conversion
- Custom naming patterns with `-P/--pattern` option for batch mode
  - `{basename}` or `{name}` - Input filename without extension
  - `{page}` - Page number with automatic padding
  - `{page:03d}` - Page number with custom padding (e.g., 001, 002)
  - `{text}` - Extracted text from page (requires -n flag)
  - `{date}` - Current date in YYYYMMDD format
  - `{time}` - Current time in HHMMSS format
